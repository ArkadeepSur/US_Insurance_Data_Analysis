# 🧮 Insurance Cost Analysis – Python Portfolio Project

This project reads and analyzes data from a CSV file (`insurance.csv`) containing medical insurance information. It calculates average costs, explores relationships between variables such as smoking status, BMI, age, region, and number of children, and helps understand the factors affecting insurance pricing.
